  <p>My focus is on a few areas right now:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Human meaning in a post-AGI world, combining work from psychoanalysis, psychiatry, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, history and art</li>
    <li>Memetic engineering on social platforms</li>
    <li>Increasing human agency post the advent of media and social media, at individual, group and national levels</li>
    <li>Automating and lowering the cost of commercial cultural insight</li>
    <li>Using AI agents to run rapid large-scale RCTs and natural experiments online</li>
    <li>The concept of stuck culture, or glitch culture as I've called it</li>
    <li>Understanding how humans can improve at forecasting and thinking probabilistically</li>
    <li>The psychology of card games</li>
    <li>How advertising sublimates and hacks desire, and mapping a more detailed grammar of unconscious desire</li>
  </ul>
