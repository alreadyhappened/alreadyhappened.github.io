  <p>I'm Stefan. A behavioural and cultural researcher based in London.</p>

  <p>Right now I am building a memetic engineering company. I am interested in understanding and managing what makes people believe things. If you are doing something similar, could do with my help, or just have questions, feel free to get in touch.</p>

  <p>I'm a behavioural scientist by trade. I graduated from the London School of Economics with an MSc in Behavioural Science in 2020. Then I went to work at the UK Nudge Unit in Westminster for a couple of years, running policy experiments for government departments.</p>

  <p>After that, I went to work in behavioural and cultural insight for a private agency, where I ran bespoke research on the human side of AI for Big Tech brands.</p>

  <p>I am focused on the relationship between psychology, media, and technology. I rarely think about anything else, to be honest.</p>

  <p>You can find my public writing on my <a href="https://alreadyhappened.xyz">substack</a>. Which is also about those things.</p>
