      <p>I'm Stefan. A behavioural and cultural researcher based in London.</p>

      <p>Right now I am building a <span class="redacted" style="width:13em" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</span>. I am interested in understanding and managing what makes people <span class="redacted" style="width:6.5em" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</span>. If you are doing something similar, could do with my help, or just have questions, feel free to get in touch.</p>

      <p>I'm a behavioural scientist by trade. I graduated from the London School of Economics with an MSc in Behavioural Science in 2020. Then I went to work at the UK Nudge Unit in Westminster for a couple of years, running policy experiments for government departments.</p>

      <p>After that, I went to work in behavioural and cultural insight for a private agency, where I've run bespoke research on the human side of AI for Big Tech brands.</p>

      <p>I am focused on the relationship between psychology, media, and technology. I rarely think about anything else, to be honest.</p>

      <p>You can find my public writing on my <a href="https://alreadyhappened.xyz">substack</a>. Which is also about those things.</p>
